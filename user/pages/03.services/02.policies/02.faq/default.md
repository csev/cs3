**Can I pay for this service?**

No.  This is a free service.  If you want to support the effort, please join <a href="https://www.apereo.org" target="_blank">Apereo</a> and support the Tsugi project.   In time there will be Tsugi Commercial Affiliates that will provide expanded versionf of this type of service commercially.

**How do I build a tool and host it on this site**

This site only hosts tools that are open source and accepted as part of the <a href="https://github.com/tsugitools" target="_blank">Tsugi Tools</a> project in
Apereo.  If you have a Tsugi tool, you need to move the source code into this project, and get all the intellectual property cleared using Apereo <a href="https://www.apereo.org/licensing/agreements" target="_blank">Contributor License Agreements</a>.  Once that is done and the code has passed code review, it will be added to this site for free hosting.   If you want a place to stage your Tsugi tools in public but without the licensing rigor of the Tsugi Tools organization, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tsugicontrib" target="_blank">Tsugi Contrib</a> area but those tols are not eligible for hosting on TsugiCloud.org.
